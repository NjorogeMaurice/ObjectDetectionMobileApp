# Object Detection Mobile Application

This project is a component of another project in robotics. The project empowers robots ability to move through obstacles on their own using power of Computer Vision.

# Introduction

 Computers are constantly pushed to interpret and understand the content of images and videos. Object detection is a fundamental computer vision technique that tackles this challenge. It allows us to identify and locate objects within an image or video stream.

 # Object Detection Techniques used:

 This project uses two models: YOLOV8 and MobileNet SSD, to detect obstacles along the robot path.

 # Project Implementation: 

 ## Data used
 The models were trained on custom dataset.

 ## Model training
 The models were trained using Google Colab GPUs

 ## Model Deployment
 Both models were converted to TF lite files. TF Lite ensures compatibility and leverages mobile-optimized operations.

 # Tools used

 Android Studio, for mobile application development
 
 Roboflow, for data labelling
 
 Google Colab, for model training
